Random event / number /variable	--> 	A variable or event or number is said to be random when all the outcomes have equal chances of occurring.

Probability function		--> 	A function that assigns a number between 0 and 1, on the probability of the occurrence of the outcome.
	
Discrete distribution		--> 	A distribution in which data can take certain values 

Continuous distribution		--> 	A distribution in which data can take any value is a specified range

Probability distribution	--> 	A mathematical description of outcomes

Bernoulli's distribution 	--> 	It is a discrete probability distribution of a random event that has a binary outcome (True or false). The success is 					    	associated with a probability 'P' and that of the fail as '1-P'	

Binomial distribution 		--> 	It is a distribution that describes the behaviour the outputs of n random experiments, each having a Bernoulli 							distribution, with probability 'P'.
					The number R of successes in N Bernoulli trials with probability P of success, is Binomially distributed
					Remember that a Bernoulli trial is one where the outcome of an event is binary. Success or failure.
					So when we do 10 Bernoulliâ€™s trials of a coin flip, then getting 5 heads is binomially distributed

Bernoulli's trial 		--> 	The simplest trial that can be conducted in statistics/probability. It's an experiment where one can has only one of 2 						possible outcomes.

Probability Mass function	-->	The probability	of a set of discrete outcomes

Parameter			--> 	Parameter is a specific characteristic of a population

Statistic			-->	statistic is a specific characteristic of a sample
