EDA                 --> the base on which more advanced statistical analysis is built
histogram           --> A graphical study of the data distribution
Bin Bias            --> often times the way the histogram is interpretted can be affected by the way we bin the data.
                        binning, omits data, because of which histogram is unable to represent every data point. Instead of this, we can use
                        Bee swarm plot available in the seaborn library
